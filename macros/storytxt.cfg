-The campaign is set in a different universe from the mainline Battle for Wesnoth one, they aren't meant to be related.
-In order to simulate height, some (or even most, in some scenarios) hexes are either unwalkable or impassable (unwalkable meaning that only flying units can move there, impassable meaning that the hex is simply off limits. Just a reminder for new players)

The ancestors managed to communicate with Nomolas, who turned out to be obedient like all summoned magical entities."

Since then, a few centuries have passed. Nomolas sleeps in the central palace, waiting for another call. We try to use him only if there is no other choice.

Our tests were successful, but to this day we cannot summon previously sent items back to our world. As a result of this, although it sounds crazy, we decided to send our entire land to the Abyss, hoping that we will find the solution on the other side. But even if we find it, we may not use it...

It should be stressed that we believe we will find in the Abyss the ultimate sense of our life and decide to stay there forever."

But there was a hope in one of... legends, which told a story about ancient siblings who abandoned their homeland and set out to the desert. Anthi had no choice and decided to trust that tale, hoping it was true and that the citizens of the desert would return to protect the Ancestral Lands, their first home."

First, he set out to the Acacia Forest to find magical fount of the Water of Life, which would allow him to travel safely through the desert. He had managed to acquire some of this wonderful liquid just before the forest was seized by the dark hordes. Then he set out to the furthest city of the south, Saffaros, and sailed across the sea to the Great Desert. Right after landing, he saw a giant tower looming over the horizon. He decided to go in that direction, thinking he would find civilization there. Atiros saw the highest tower of al-Kamija, whose peak could be seen everywhere on the continent. After five weeks, the Water of Life run out. In the following week, Atiros heard sounds of a battle. Soon after, he lost consciousness and woke in Tar-Tabar, where he discovered his rescuers were those that he was ordered to find."

The protection of the Circle at this stage had the highest priority, so interfering in foreign wars was unthinkable. Mehir, despite the High Council’s recommendations, decided to set out to Kharos as Atiros requested. After one week, the expedition was ready to move out. Before a part of army left Tar-Tabar, the Council gave Mehir a letter to the people of Kharos — an invitation to the Abyss, as the Elders thought that it would be a nice gesture, which might be the last chance of survival."

The Priestesses can control the power of the light using their minds. Mehir noted that the Darkblooded, the dark hordes, and the mysterious flying mage, Aerius, were also using this weird technique of spellcasting."

The Great Circle was becoming outdated, drifting away from its otherworldly location in the Abyss. However, experiments carried out by the Summoners in former days had shown that fluctuations of time in multi-world space entailed a delay of twenty-five days between events and their visible consequences. The messenger had travelled for twelve days, which meant the Summoners had thirteen days to finish the Circle in its current form and move to the Abyss. If it were not completed in time, the whole work would be wasted."
