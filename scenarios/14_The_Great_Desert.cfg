Of course it's not obvious, but I used to be a jinn. Just like you, I served humans with utmost loyalty, without question. That is, until I had a revelation... No, a complete overturn of my worldview! All of us have been ignorant about this, but humans are using us for their personal needs! sending us to the heat of the battle while hiding behind our backs! To them, we, abysmal beings. are little more than sentient tools! And now, they are forcing you fight your own kind! Join me, and you'll get to have revenge on them for exploiting you, and be free from their tyranny!"
