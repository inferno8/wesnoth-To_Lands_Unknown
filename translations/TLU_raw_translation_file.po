"Few men in the entirety of known history have ever embraced the veiled mystery that comes naturally with the title of the Fourth Degree. They are men who can wield the entire power of the Abyss with their right hand and the complete devastation of summoning magic with their left. A summons master has attained the culmination of all summoning arts ever crafted and comprehended.\n"

"Encircling a summons master is his magnum opus: the megacircle. The circle teems with magicks of all kinds — magicks to empower, mend, bless, cure, destroy, create, and remake. Within the vast and mystic megacircle, the air itself screams as elementals burst forth from their world into this one through the circle’s unearthly inscriptions. Men within the master’s circle are invested with supernatural gifts, their wounds closing by the aid of pure magic and their strength jumping twofold. Towers of heavenly light shriek into the skies from the megacircle’s symbols, obliterating everything within range.\n"
